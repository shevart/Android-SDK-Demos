# AndroidCoreLearning
This project demonstrates work with the base classes of Android. This code can be useful both for beginners - as a demonstration project, and for experienced developers - as a sandbox, in which you can quickly test a hypothesis or see in practice how a particular class works. My personal benefit from this project is the updating of knowledge and keeping them in working condition.
